# Flickr Map

This script generates a map with markers for all photos in a user's Flickr™ photostream.

[![Map Example](img/map.png)](https://haraldofilho.github.io/flickr-map/example/)

The script was developed to run on _Linux_ systems with _Python 3.x_ installed and it uses *[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)™* and *[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)™* APIs.

See [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HaraldoFilho/flickr-map) for detailed instructions on how to install, configure and use the script.
